*********************************
Hints and Tricks On this Update:
Version 1.05 tips and tricks
*********************************

This document assumes you have used the wands.  It covers the voice and .commands in a bit more detail so hopefully you feel comfortable using them.

The big new features other than simply adding HotU and SoU content are the custom encounters on the Encounter wand to allow you to lay down and customize in game a group of monsters to spawn.  The Affliction wand is overhauled and now gives more feedback and can report immunities.

Good news is that I have now added this whole readme into two in game books for you and for your players.  So if you need a listing of emotes or want to use the .commands, there is a reference in game.



SKILL CHECK ROLLS:
------------------

Animations can be turned off for DM driven skill checks.  Use the settings via the DM Dicebag conversion or use the following new .commands.

.aniy = for animation yes
.anin = for animation no



CUSTOM ENCOUNTERS:
------------------

There are directions in game on the custom object named "Custom Encounter".  The Encounter wand has an option for Custom Encounters.  For these to work, you need to do a bit of work in the toolset.

I recommend creating a separate area (like the treasure system) for these encounters.  Place up to nine "Custom Encounter" objects - CHANGE THE TAG to be DMFI_E* where * is a number from one to nine.  Change the name to something that means something like "Goblins - 1st cave".  That is all you need to do in the toolset.

In game, jump to that region and use the creator to place monsters "into" the ring.  Use the encounter wand and you will see under the custom encounters the "names" of the custom objects - as a quick reminder.  You can adjust the monsters at any time.  If the circle is empty then nothing will be created.  There is NO "scaling" of the encounter.  What you place is exactly what you will get, but this is a pretty quick / easy way to have 9 adjustable encounters that you can lay down quickly.

The ditto wand works for these just like the regular encounters.


VOICE FEATURES:
---------------

The voice and command features are powerful.  I personally shyed away for some time but these can really be huge time savers.  As long as there is an NPC, summon, or familiar around, no voice needed.

The one thing that everyone needs to remember is redundant text is ignored.  Therefore if you type *strength* and it doesn't work, then typing it again will certainly not work.  You need to type something to clear the "cache".  The reason for this is simple.  If 8 npcs hear something, you don't want the code to fire 8 times.

In a conversation, if you see "voice driven" that means that a setting creature will appear and you must be visible and speak in float format (ie 4.0).  If successful, you see the setting in a floating text message.  If not, then it wasn't captured for some reason.


Tell your players to use *action* emotes.

Things like *prays at the alter* *drinks the ale*
Here is a list from the Voice readme.

In addition players can quickly roll skill checks by using this feature.  Just type something like *uses strength to move the big rock* will not only add a bit of flare to the game but rolls the skill check.  Two purposes and faster than using the dicebag.

All the skills are implemented (the list below is old) and now there is NO need to capitalize the first letter.  It is case insensitive on the first letter so you could type *Craft Armor* *Craft armor* or *craft armor* and it can be mixed with other text as shown above.

.commands - The next real category of things the voice can do.
--------------------------------------------------------------

First the new features to let the DMs have the power of the *skill rolls* that the players have.  All of these commands DO NOT require the use of the dm channel.  Just type in talk while you are "disappeared" and the code is run.

Skill checks:  Ability, Saves and Skill checks can now be rolled by typing ".strength" or ".strength all".  The target for the skill check will be the last player or object targetted with ANY DMFI widget (other than the voice wand or widget).

So to be clear, you can "cache" two different types of targets with the DMFI set.  One is a default voice that is loaded to ":" on the DM channel by default (remember you can set up others like & % $ - see the .set command below) and the last target of the other DM wands.

This lets you possess a creature, throw your voice to another creature, and keep a player targetted for .skill checks.

The .skills should all be lower case and if you use the word "all" at the end, then all PCs in the area will roll a skill check.  You can always target a NPC with the DMFI wands to have the .skills roll for NPCs instead.

In reality this is much faster than opening up the conversation tree and finding the skill.  If you do not have a valid DMFI target, the default voice target is used and you will get a server message telling you of this invalid target and transfer.

Broadcast messaging can be changed by the following commands.  This is the same setting that DM dicebag will use, just another shortcut.

.global (a shout)
.local	(simple talk)
.private (DM and roller)
.dm (DM only)



The other .commands
-------------------


After you've targeted an NPC, you can control them by using the following
commands (on the DM channel if PCs are around, or you can use normal talk if no
PCs are around).

.appearance ***** - This command allows you change the appearance of the DMFI target.  (either the last one used by ANY DMFI Wand (except voice wand/widget) or the target set by the DMFI Target Widget).  For a full list of appearances, examine the Target / 2DA data widget.

.buff x - This command "buffs" the creature for the time span of one hour realtime, where x is a string that describes the buff.

These general buffs apply around 3-4 buffs that should be level appropriate

***new ones***

.buff low	(level 5)
.buff mid	(level 10)
.buff high	(level 15)
.buff epic	(level 20)

***************


.buff barkskin - Barkskin (+3AC)
.buff elements - Resist Elements (20 points, all elemental damage)
.buff haste - Haste
.buff invis - Invisibility
.buff plot - Sets the plot flag
.buff stoneskin - Stoneskin (+3/10 damage reduction, 100 points of soak)
.buff truesight - True Seeing
.buff unplot - Removes the plot flag

.damage x - This command inflicts x amount of damage to the NPC, where x is any number.

.dismiss - This command destroys the NPC, making the NPC disappear.


these commands allow you to set the faction of the targeted NPC. Pretty self-explanatory.

.faction hostile
.faction defender
.faction merchant
.faction commoner 

.fly Makes the NPC "fly away" (Destroys the NPC in the process)

.freeze - This command freezes the NPC, preventing the NPC from acting. May not always work.


.follow x - This command makes the NPC follow you for x seconds. May not always 
    work, and it is difficult to stop the NPC from following you.

.get x - Jumps NPC/PC defined by the control character x (using .set) to your location

.goto x - Jumps you to the NPC/PC defined by the control character x (using .set)

.heal x - This command heals the NPC for x amount

.language xxxx - This command changes the language of the targeted creature to 
whatever you type. Example - .language Abyssal

.mute - This command prevents an NPC from making it's usual "click to talk"
    conversation. It is identical to the Mute NPC toggle.

.remove - This command removes all effects on the targeted creature

.say xx - This command makes the NPC say the prepared phrase corresponding to
    the number. This works well if you already know the phrase you want to say.

.set X - This allows you to set the "control character" for this NPC. The
control character is the prefix that you need to throw your voice to the NPC.
You can set this to any non-alphanumeric character except "[" ":" and "." (all
reserved). Note that using a control character already being used by another
PAdmin/DM will overwrite the previous setting.
Usage example: "/dm .set *" sets the control character of the targeted NPC to *.
Now to throw my voice at that NPC, I type "/dm *Hey, you. Come back here!".

The advantage of control characters is that you can throw your voice to the
NPC regardless of what area you are in, as long as you are nearby any other
NPC.

You can also use .commands on pre-.set NPCs. So to damage the NPC in the previous example, you type:
/dm *.damage 10

.unfreeze - This command negates the freeze command.

.unmute - This command negates .mute. It is identical to the Mute NPC toggle.

All NON-SKILL RELATED .commands can be truncated to three letters (for example, you can use
.fac defender instead of .faction defender).  Skills can't be truncated.
