DMFI Version 1.09 & CEP 2.2
---------------------------
***************************

[February 2, 2009]

CEP 2.2 includes a hak from the C.R.A.P. project called cep2_crp_s.hak. Unfortunately, this hak includes a DMFI file from an old release. This causes problems when trying to use this optional CEP hak and DMFI 1.09.

SUGGESTED WORKAROUND
--------------------
The conflicting DMFI script is actually an include file called dmfi_dmw_inc, and it is referenced by only one script in DMFI 1.09: dmfi_execute.

1. Copy the script file dmfi_dmw_inc to dmfi_dmwx_inc. (You can do this by opening the file in the script editor and choosing the Save As icon from the toolbar.)
2. Edit the dmfi_execute script and change the #include line at the top of the file from dmfi_dmw_inc to dmfi_dmwx_inc. Save and compile.
3. Delete the now-unused dmfi_dmw_inc from your module.

This should allow you to use CEP 2.2 and DMFI 1.09 together. Contact tsunami282 via the Bioware message boards if you need help.
